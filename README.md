# ImageFolder

This is a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) plugin that adds a new tab to the expression picker window that makes it easy to store and send images.

## Usage

With this plugin installed, a new button will appear on the right of the text box, and a new tab will appear in the expression picker window. Within it, you can add images from elsewhere on your computer. You can also create folders within the tab to organize your images. Clicking on an image will upload it to the current channel.

## Memory Usage

Every image in the current folder is loaded into memory when the window is opened. This shouldn't be a big problem, but it's something to keep in mind if you have a lot of high resolution images. This can be avoided by making subfolders (and you can stay more organized that way too).
